## Notebook Information

- Notebook: [Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM](https://github.com/Elixirion/Handwriting_Digit_Recognition/blob/main/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_using_SVM.ipynb)
- Original file generated by Colaboratory

## Dataset

The code utilizes the `load_digits` dataset from the scikit-learn library. This dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding target labels.

## Summarize Dataset

The code includes a section that summarizes the dataset:
- Prints the data
- Prints the target labels
- Prints the shape of the data
- Prints the shape of the images
- Prints the total number of images


## Visualize the Dataset

To provide a visual representation of the dataset, the code plots a specific image using matplotlib:
- Displays the grayscale image of a handwritten digit
- Helps in understanding the data and its structure


## Splitting Train & Test

The code splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn:
- Splits the data and target labels into training and testing sets
- Controls the proportion of data allocated for testing (in this case, 25% of the data)
- Enables evaluation of the trained model on unseen data


## Training

The code uses the SVM algorithm with a linear kernel to train the model:
- Initializes an SVM model with the `SVC` class and the `linear` kernel
- Fits the model on the training data to learn the patterns and features of handwritten digits


## Predicting the Digit from Test Data

The code includes a section that predicts the digit for a specific image from the test data:
- Uses the trained SVM model to predict the digit based on the pixel representation of the image
- Displays the image and the predicted digit
- Helps assess the performance of the trained model on individual samples


## Prediction for Test Data

The code predicts the digits for the entire test dataset using the trained SVM model:
- Applies the trained model to the test data to predict the digits
- Concatenates the predicted labels and true labels for comparison
- Provides an overview of the model's predictions on the test dataset


## Evaluate Model - Accuracy Score

The code evaluates the accuracy of the trained model using the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn:
- Calculates the accuracy score by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels of the test dataset
- Provides a metric to assess the performance of the trained model


## Play with Different Methods

The code explores different SVM models with varying parameters:
- Compares the accuracy scores of SVM models with different kernels (linear and radial basis function)
- Evaluates models with different gamma and C values
- Allows experimentation with different SVM configurations for improved accuracy

Please refer to the original notebook for a more detailed explanation of the code and its implementation. The repository assumes familiarity with the scikit-learn library and basic concepts of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for machine learning.


## Dependencies
